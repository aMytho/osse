# Osse

Osse is a free and open source music player and server. This repository is the **server**.

## Features

> Osse is in **early development**. There will be bugs and unexpected behavior. Some features are not yet complete. It is safe to use on your library, but it will need some time before it can be your main music player.

- Supports most music formats (MP3, Ogg/Opus, Flac, WAV).
- Support reading tags for library generation.
- Album & Playlist support.
- No Tracking/Telemetry/Data collection.
- Simplicity. Install it and it **just works**.
- Support for Linux/Mac/Windows (Mac/Windows need Docker or other medium). Any device (including Android and IOS) can use the web frontend.

## Installation 

> Interested in helping us test? Use the below instructions for an installation.

Docker is the recommended method of installation. You can also use Podman. Alternatively, you can run Osse on your local machine by installing it's dependencies.

Devices with constrained resources should use the manual installation for performance reasons. Systemd files are available in this repo.
